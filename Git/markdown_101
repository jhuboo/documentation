--------------------------
  The Basics of Markdown
--------------------------

- Headings
    ~> # h1/largest heading
    ~> ##  h2 heading
    ~> ###### h6/smallest heading

- Styling Text
    ~> **This is bold text**
    ~> *This text is italicized*
    ~> ~~This is strikethrough text~~
    ~> **This text is _italicized here_ and bold everywhere else**
    ~> ***This text is both bold and italicized***

- Quoting Text
    ~> > This is a quote

- Quoting Code
    ~> ``` The text in here is quoted and can be used as multiline ```

- Links
    ~> This is a [my page](https://anveshjhuboo.com).

- Section Links
    - We can also link over sections within the text by hovering over the section heading
    - to expose the link

- Relative Links
    - A relative link is a link that is relative to the current file

- Lists
    ~> - Person A 
    ~> - Person B 
    ~> - Person C
    
    ~> 1. Person D
    ~> 2. Person E
    ~> 3. Person F

- Nested lists
    ~> 1. First list item
        - First nested list item
            - Second nested list item

- Task lists
    ~> - [x] Marked changes
    ~> - [ ] Unmarked changes

- Mentoining People and Teams
    ~> @neuralx7 What do you think of these updates?

- Using emoji
    ~> @neuralx7 :+1: This looks great! :shipit:

- Paragraph
    - You can create a new paragraph by leaving a blank line between lines of text

- Ignore Markdown formatting
    - You can ignore/escape Markdown formatting by using \ before the Markdown character
    ~> Ignore this \*markdown character\* in this project


- Organizing information with tables
    ~> | First Header | Second Header | Third Header |
    ~> | :--          |     :--:      |          --: |
    ~> | Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell |
    ~> | Left-Align   |   Centered    | Right-Align  |
    ~> | Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell |

- Creating and highlighting code blocks
    ```
    function test() {
        console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
    }
    ````

- Syntax highlighting
    ```ruby
    require 'redcarpet`
    markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello world!")
    puts markdown.to_html
    ```

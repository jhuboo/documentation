Clever Tricks
----
----

Replace: ~> :%s/four/4/g      // Replace all "four" with 4, but also replaces thirtyfour
Replace: ~> :%s/\<four/4/g    // Replace all words beginning with "four" with 4, but also fourteen
Replace: ~> :%s/\<four\>/4/g  // Replace only "four" with 4
Replace: ~> :%s/\<four\>/4/gc // Replace with confirmation, say we want to replace only in comments

On all files?
// Say we want to replace "GetHello" with "GetCiaoWorld" on all *.cpp files
Open    : ~> vim *.cpp                        // Open all cpp files
Register: ~> qq                               // Start recording in the q register
Replace : ~> :%s/\<GetHello\>/GetCiaoWorld/ge // Do replacement in first file, flag 'e' tells that not finding a match is not an eror
Wnext   : ~> :wnext                           // Write this file and move to the next one
Register: ~> q                                // Stop recording
Execute : ~> @q                               // Exectute q register. : ~> 999@q for all remaining files

Change "Last, First" to "First, Last"
Regex   : ~> :s/\(^,)*\), \(.*\)/\2 \1/       // Leo, Jack   -> Jack Leo
*                                             // Sonny, Pete -> Pete Sonny

Reverse line order
Command: ~> :global/^/m 0                     // Operates line-wise, moving current line just below mythical zeroth line, hence reversing the file
Command: ~> :'s+1,.g/^/m 's                   // Also operates with mark s

Count words
Command: ~> g Ctrl-G                          // Counts the words in Normal Mode, use also in Visual Mode for selected lines or block of text

Man Page
Command: ~> K (on the word)                   // Vim runs external "man" program on the word
Command: ~> :Man [program]                    // opens man page for program
Links  : ~> Ctrl-J                            // Jump forwards to another linked page
Links  : ~> Ctrl-O                            // Jump backwards ""

Trim blanks
Command: ~> :%s/\s\+$//                       // Finds space chars (\s) one or more times till the end of the file ($) and replace them with nothing

Grep (Where a word is used)
Command: ~> vim `grep -l frame_counter *.c`   // Searches through all *.c files for list of files containing word 'frame_counter' and list thems
*                                             // Enclosed between (` `) because this tells shells to pretend that command was executed on command line

Finding each file
Command: ~> :grep error_string *.c            // Finds strign "error_string" in all specified files (*.c)
*                                             // use :cnext, :cprev, :clist as supplements

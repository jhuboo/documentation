Chapter 2 Summary
-----------------

- Linux consists of one big filesystem, with root dir(/) being at the top of the inverted tree.
    - Within this large logical filesystem, there may be different distinct filesystems, mounted at various points, which appear as subdirs.
        - Regardless of how things are joined together, it all looks just as one big cohesive filesystem.
        - Applications do not usually care on what physical device the files actually reside on.
        - This standardization allows the Linux ecosystem to make it easier to write and manage system adminstration tasks, among others.
- Data Distinctions (How data is organized and classifed with the FHS) 
    - Shareable vs. non-shareable
        - Shareable data is that which can be shared between different hosts. 
        - Non-shareable data is that which must be specific to a particular host.
    - Variable vs. static
        - Static data include binaries, libraries, documentation, and anything that does not change without a SysAdmin assistance. 
        - Variable data is anything tha may change even without a SysAdmin help.
- The Filesystem Hierachy Standard (FHS)
    - Original document: refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs-3.0.pdf
    - By specifying a standard layout, the FHS simplifies predictions of file locations.
- FHS Linux Standard Dir Tree
    Dir     In FHS?     Purpose
    /       yes         Primary dir of entire filesystem hierachy
    /bin    yes         Essential exe program that must be available in single user mode 
    /boot   yes         File needed to boot the system such as kernel, initrd and boot config files and bootloader programs
    /dev    yes         Device Nodes, used to interact with hardware and software devices
    /etc    yes         System-wide config files
    /home   yes         User home directories, including personal files, files,etc
    /lib    yes         Libraries required by exe binaries in /bin and /sbin
    /lib64  no          64-bit libaries required "" for systems which can run both 32-bit and 64-bit programs
    /media  yes         mount points for removable media such as CDs, DVDs, USB sticks, etc
    /mnt    yes         Temporarily mounted filesystems
    /opt    yes         Optional application software packages
    /proc   yes         Virtual pseudo-filesystem giving info about system/processes running. Can be used to alter system parameters
    /sys    no          Virtual pseudo-filesystem "". Similar to a device tree and is part of the Unifed Device Model
    /root   yes         Home dir for the root user
    /sbin   yes         Essential system binaries
    /srv    yes         Site-specific data served by the system. Seldom used
    /tmp    yes         Temporary files; on many distros lost across a reboot and may be a ramdisk in memory
    /usr    yes         Multi-user applications, utitiles and data; theoritically read-only
    /var    yes         Variable data that changes during system operation

    - There may be additional distro specific dirs under root, such as /misc and /tfpboot. 
    - NOTE: it is not a violation to have other directories in the FHS. 
    - However, it does violate it to have components in dirs other than those dictated by the standard.

Chapter 3 Summary
-----------------

- Programs, Processes, & Threads
    - A program is a set of instructions, along with any internal data used while carrying the instructions out. Programs may also use external data.
    - A process is an executing program and associated resources, including environment, open files, signal handlers, etc.
    - A thread, or threads of execution, can share various resources, such as their entire memory spaces (or just particular memory spaces), open files, etc. When there is an everything shared circumstance, one speaks of multi-threaded process.
- A Process (Expanded)
    - A process is an instance of a program in execution.
    - Every process has a pid (Process ID), a ppid (Parent Process ID), and a pgid (Process Group ID).
a    - In addition, each process has program code, data, variables, file descriptors, and an environment.
- The 'init' process
    - init is usually the first user process run on a system, and thus becomes the ancestor of all subsequent processes running on the system, except for those initiated directly from the kernel (which show up with [] around their name in a ps listing)
    - If the parent process dies before the child, the ppid of the child is set to 1; the process is adopted by init. (NOTE: in recent Linux systesm using systemd, the ppid will be set to 2, which corresponds to an internal kernel thread known as 'kthreadd', which has taken over from init the role of adopter of orphaded children.)
    - A child process which terminates before its parent, which has not waited for it and examined its exit code, is known as a zombie/defunct process. Zombies have released almost all resources, and remain only to convey their exit status. One function of the init process is to checked on its adopted children, and let those who have terminated die gracefully. (Hence it is known as the zombie killer/child reaper).
    - Processes are controlled by scheduling, which is completely preemptive. Only the kernel has the right to preempt a process; they cannot do it to each other.
- For historical reasons, the largest PID has been limited to 16-bit number, or 32768. It is possible to alter this value by changing /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max, since it may be inadequatefor larger servers. As processes are created, eventually they will reach pid_max, at which point they will start again at PID = 300.
- Process Attributes
    - All processes have certain attributes:
        - The program being executed
        - Context (state)
        - Permissions
        - Associated resources
    - Every Process is executing some program. The context of the processis a snapshot of itself, which includes the state of its CPU registers, where it is executing in the program, what is in the process' memory, and other information.
    - Since processes can be scheduled in and out when sharing CPU time with others, being able to store the entire context when swapping out the process and being able to restore it upon execution resumption is critical to the kernel's ability to do context switching.
    - Every process has permissions based on which user has called it to execute. I may also have permissions based on who owns its program file. Programs which are marked with an "s" execute bit have adiffernt "effective" user id than their "real" user id. These programs are referred to as setuid programs. They run wiht the user-id of the user who owns the program, where a non-setuid program runs with the permissions of the user who starts it. 'setuid' programs owned by root can be a security problem.
- Process Resource Isolation
    - When a process is started, it is isolated in its own user space to protect it from other processes. This promotes security and creates greater stability.
    - Processes do not directly access hardware. Hardware is managed by the kernel, so a process must use system calls to indirectly access hardware. System calls are the fundamental interface between an application and the kernel.
- Controlling Processes with ulimit
    - : ~> ulimit  (is a built-in bash command that displays or resets a number of resource limits assocaited with processes running under a shell.)
    - A sysadmin may need to change some of these values in either direction:
        - To restrict capabilities so an individual user and/or process cannot exhaust system resources, such as memory, cpu time or the max number of processes on the system.
        - To expand capabilites so a process does not run into resource limits.
    - There are two kinds of limits:
        - Hard
            - The max value, set only by the root user, that a user can raise the resource limit to. (: ~> ulimit -H -n)
        - Soft
            - The current limiting value, which a user can modify, but cannot exceed the hard limit. (: ~> ulimit -S -n)
    - One can set any particular limit by doing:
        - : ~> ulimit [options] [limit]
    - NOTE: the changes only affect the current shell. To make changes that are effective for all logged-in users, :~> /etc/security/limits.conf needs to be modified, before rebooting.
- Process States
    - Processes can be in one of several possible states:
        - Running
            - The process is either currently executing on a CPU or CPU core or sitting in the run queue, waiting for a new time slice. It will resume running when the scheduler decides it is now deserving to occupy the CPU, or when another CPU becomes idle, and the scheduler migrates the process to that CPU.
        - Sleeping
            - The process is waiting on a request (usually I/O) that it has made and cnnot proceed further until the request is completed. When the request is completed, the kernel will wake up the process and put it back on the run queue, and it will be given a time slice on a CPU when the scheduler decides to do do so.
        - Stopped
            - The process has been suspended. This state is commonly experienced when a programmer wnats to examine the executing program's memory, CPU registers, flags, or other attributes. Done via Ctrl-Z
        - Zombie
            - The process enters this state when it terminates, and no other process (usually the parent) has inquired about its exit state, ie, reaped it. Also called a defunct process, a zombie process has released all of its resources, except its exit state and its entry in the process table. If the parent of any process dies, the process is adopted by init (PID = 1) or kthreadd (PID = 2).
- Execution Modes
    - User Mode vs System Mode / Kernel Mode
        - User Mode
            - Except when executing a system call, processes execute in user mode, where they have lesser privileges than in the kernl mode.
            - When a process is started, it is isolated in its won user space to protect it from other processes. This is called process resource isolation.
            - Even a process run by the root user or as 'setuid' program runs in user mode, expect when jumping into a system call, and has only limited ability to access hardware.
        - System (Kernel) Mode
            - Here, the CPU has full access to all hardware on the system, including peripherals, memory, disks, etc. If an application needs access to these resources, it must issue a system call, which causes a context switch from user mode to kernel mode. This procedure must be follwed when reading and writing from files, creating a new process, etc.
            - Application never runs in kernel mode, only the system call itself which is kernel code. When the system call is complete, a return value is produced and the process returns to user mode with the inverse context switch.
            - There are other times when the system is in kernel mode that have nothing to do with processes, such as when handling hardware interrupts or running the scheduling routines and other management tasks for the system.
- Daemons
    - A daemon process is a background process whose sole purpose is to provide some specific service to users of the system:
        - Daemons can be efficient because they only operate when needed.
        - Many daemons are started at boot time.
        - Daemons names often (but not always) end with d.
        - Some examples are httpd and systemd-udevd
        - Daemons may respond to external events (systemd-udevd) or elapsed time(crond)
        - Daemons genereally have no controlling terminal and no standard input/output devices.
        - Daemons sometimes provide better security control.
- Creating Processes / Forking
    - An average Linux system is always creating new processes/forking. The original parent process keeps running while the new child process starts.
    - 'fork and exec' is where the parent process terminates, and the child process inherits the process ID of the parent.
    - Older UNIX system often used a program called 'spawn', which is somewhat similar to 'fork and exec'.
    - : ~> ps [flags]
- Creating Processes in a Command Shell
    - What happens when a user executes a command in a command shell interpreter, such as bash/zsh?
        - A new process is creates (forked from the user's login shell)
        - A wait system call puts the parent shell process to sleep.
        - The command is loaded onto the child procss's space via the exec system call. ie, the code for the command replaces the bash program in the child's process memory space.
        - The command completes executing, and the child process dies via the exit system call.
        - The parent shell is re-awakened by the death of the childprocess and proceeds to issue a new shell prompt.
        - The parent shell then waits for the next command request from the user, at which time the cycle will be repeated.
    - If a command is issued for background processing (&), the parent shell skips the waiting time and is free to issue a new shell prompt immediately, allowing the background process to execute in parallel. Otherwise, for foreground requests, the shell waits until the child process has completed or is stopped via a signal.
    - Some shell commands, such as echo or kill, are built into the shell itself, and do not involve loading of program files. For these commands, no fork or exec are issued for execution.
- Using 'nice' to set Priorities
    - process priority can be controlled through the nice and renice commands. The higher the nicesses, the lower the priority.
    - The niceness value can range from -20 (highest priority) to +19 (lowest priority).
        - : ~> nice -n 5 command [ARGS]
        - : ~> nice -5 command [ARGS]
        - The default is to increase by '10' if no value is given.
- Renice
    - renice is used to raise or lower the nice value of an already running process.
    - : ~> renice --help
      : ~> renice [-n] [-p|--pid] <pid> ...
    - by default, only a superuser can decrease the niceness, increase the priority. However it is possible to give normal users the ability to decrease the niceness withing a predetermied range, by editing : ~> /etc/security/limits.conf
- Static and Shared Libraries
    - Programs are built using libraries of code, developed for multiple purposes and uses and reused in many contexts.
        - Static
            - The code for the library functions is inserted in the program at compile time, and does not change thereafter, even if the library is updated.
        - Shared
            - The code for the library functions is loaded into the program at run time, and if the library is changed later, the running program runs with the new library modifications.
    - Using shared libraries is more efficient because they can be used by many appliations at once; memory usage, executables sizes, and application load times are reduced.
    - Shared Libraries are also alled Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs).
- Shared Libary Versions
    - Shared libaries need to be carefully versioned. If there is a significant change to the library and a program is not equipped to handle it, serious problems can be expected. This is sometimes known as DLL Hell.
    - Therefore programs can request a specific 'major' library version, rather than the latest one on the system. However, usually the program will always use the latest 'minor' version available. Some applications providers will use static libraries bundled into the program to avoid these problems.
- Finding Shared Libraries (DLLs)
    -  A program which uses shared libraries has to be able to find them at runtime.
    - : ~> ldd  (can be used to find which shared libraries an executable requires. It shows the 'soname' of the library and what file it actually points to)
    - : ~> ldconfig (lists the directories that will be searched fro shared libraries)

Chapter 4 Summary
-----------------

- Signals are used to emit notifications for processes to take action in response to often unpredictable events.
    - It is possible to send signals (including those that induce termination) using ~> kill, ~> killall, ~>pkill
- Signals are one of the oldest methods of Inter-Process Communication (IPC) and are used to notify processes about asynchronous events (or exceptions).
    - There are two paths by which signals are sent to a process:
        - From the kernel to a user process, as a exception or programming error.
        - From a user process (using a system call) to the kernel which will then send it to a user process.
- Signals are only sent between processes owned by the same user or from a process owned by the superuser of any process.
    - When a process receives a signal, how it behaves will depend on how it has been programmed under the hood. It will either take specific actions, coded in the program to take care of the signal, or just respond according to system defaults. Two signals (SIGKILL and SIGSTOP) cannot be handled and will always terminate the program.
- Types of Signals
    - Signals are generally used to handle two things:
        - Exceptions detected by hardware (ie, illegal memory ref)
        - Exceptions generated by the environment (ie, premature death of a process from the user's terminal)
- Available Signals for the x86 platform
    - SIGNAL  VALUE   DEFAULT ACTION  POSIX?  MEANING
    - -----------------------------------------------
    - SIGHUP  1   Terminate   Yes Hangup detected on controlling terminal or death of controlling process
    - SIGINT  2   Terminate   Yes Interrupt from keyboard
    - SIGQUIT 3   Core dump   Yes Quit from keyboard
    - SIGILL  4   Core dump   Yes Illegal instruction

    - SIGABTR/SIGIOT  6   Core dump   Yes Abnormal termination
    - SIGBUS  7   Core dump   Yes Bus error
    - SIGFPE  8   Core dump   Yes Floating point exception
    - SIGKILL 9   Terminate   Yes Kill signal (cannot be caught or ignored)
    - SIGUSR1 10  Terminate   Yes User-defined signal 1
    - SIGSEGV 11  Core dump   Yes Invalid memory reference

    - SIGTTIN 21  Stop    Yes Background process requires tty input
    - SIGTTOU 22  Stop    Yes Background process requires tty output
    - SIGURG  23  Ignore  No  Urgent condition on socket (4.2 BSD)
    - SIGXCPU 24  Core dump   Yes CPU time limit exceeded (4.2 BSD)
    - SIGXFSZ 25  Core dump   Yes File size limit exceeded (4.2 BSD)
    - SIGVTALRM   26  Terminate   No  Virtual alarm clock (4.2 BSD)
    - SIGPROF 27  Terminate   No  Profile alarm clock (4.2 BSD)
    - SIGWINCH    28  Ignore  No  Window resize signal (4.3 BSD, Sun)
    - SIGIO/SIGPOLL 29  Terminate   No  I/O now possible (4.2 BSD) (System V)
    - SIGPWR  30  Terminate   No  Power Failure (System V)
    - SIGSYS/SIGUNUSED   31  Terminate   No  Bad System Called. Unused signal

- kill
    - A process cannot send a signal directly to another process; it must ask the kernel to send the signal by executing a system call.
    - Users (including superuser) can send signals to other process formt eh command lien or scripts by using ~> kill, as in:
        - : ~> kill 2983            (send signal to process PID=2983)
        - : ~> kill -9 2989         (deault is SIGTERM (15), a terminate signal that can be handled)
        - : ~> kill -SIGKILL 1983

- killall and pkill
    - 'killall' kills all processes with a given name, assuming the user has sufficent privilege. It uses a command name rather than a process ID
        - ~> killall bash
        - ~> killall -9 bash
        - ~> killall -SIGKILL bash
    - 'pkill' sneds a signal to a process using selection criteria:
        - ~> pkill [-signal] [options] [pattern]
        - ~> pkill -u libby foobar (will kill all of libby's processes with name of foobar)
        - ~> pkill -HUP rsyslogd (makes rsyslog re-read its configuration file)


-----------------
Chapter 5 Summary
-----------------

- Software Packaging Concepts
    - Package management systems supply the tools that allow sysadmins to automate installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software packages in a known, predictable, and consistent manner.
- Software package management systems enable installation processes to scale to thousands of systems without requiring manual work on each individual system. Features include:
    - Automation: No need for manual installs and upgrades.
    - Scalability: Install packages on one system, or 10,000 systems.
    - Repeatability and predictability
    - Security and auditing
- Package Types
    - Binary Packages
        - contain file ready for deployment, including executable files and libraries. Are architecture-dependent, and must be compiled for each type of machine.
    - Source Packages
        - are used to generate binary packages; it's always possible to rebuild a binary package from the source package. Can be used on multiple architectures.
        - Rebuilding binary packages from their source packages (RPM systems)
        - : ~> rpmbuild --rebuild -rb p7zip-16.02-16.e18.src.rpm
        - which will place the results in /root/rpmbuild
        - : ~> root/rpmbuild>find . -name "*rpm"
        - with the exact location depending on the Linux distro and version
- Available Package Management Systems
    - RPM (Red Hat Package Manager)
        - used by all Red Hat derived distros, such as Red Hat Entreprise Linux, CentOs, Scientific Linux, and CentOs, as well as SUSE and openSUSE
    - dpkg (Debian Package)
        - used by all Debian-derived distributions, including Debian, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint.
    - There are other package management systems such as 'portage/emerge' used by Gentoo, 'pacman' used by Arch, and specialized ones used by Embedded Linux systesm and Android.
- Packaging Tool Levels and Varieties
    - Low Level Utilities
        - This simply installs or removes a single package, or list of packages, each one of whihc is individually and specifically named. dependencies are not fully handled, only warned about.
    - High Level Utilities
        - This solves the dependency problem.
        - For RPM, we have 'yum', 'dnf', 'zypper' and Package Kit utilites
        - For dpkg systems, we have 'apt', 'apt-cache'
- Creating Software Packages
    - Building your own package allwos you to control exacktly what goes in the software


-----------------
Chapter 6 Summary
-----------------

- Advantages of Using RPM
    - All files related to a specific taks or a subsystem are packages into a single file, which also contains information about how and where to install and uninstall the files.
    - Makes software packages easy to manage. EAsy to find out wihc package a particular file comes form, which verson of teh package is installed, and whether it is installed correctly. FTP or HTTP can be used to install packages. Easy to remove complete packages to free up disk space.
    - RPM also distinguishes documentation files from the rest of a package, allowing you to choose whether to install documentation on a system.
    - RPM makes software devs job easier. Often, devs have to change the code to get it to compile and execute directly on another OS. RPM allows builders to keep the changes necessary for a building on a Linux separate from the original source. This facilitates incorporating new versions of the code, because build-related changes are all in one place. It also facilitates building versions of Linux for different architectures.
- Package File Names
    - The standard format for a binary RPM package is:
        - <name>-<version>-<release>.<distro>.<architecture>.rpm
    - The standard format for source RPM package is:
        - <name>-<version>-<release>.<distro>.src.rpm
- RPM Database and Helper Programs
    - :~> /var/lib/rpm  (default sys dir which holds RPM database files in the form of Berkeley DB hash files.)
        - use --dbpath to specify alternative database dir
        - use --rebuilddb to rebuild database indices from installed package headers
    - :~> /usr/lib/rpm  (helper programs and scripts used by RPM)
    - 'rpmrc' file can be created to specify default settings for rpm:
        - :~> /usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc
        - :~> /etc/rpmrc
        - :~> ~/.rpmrc
- Queries
    - All rpm inquires include the '-q' option which can be combined with other sub-options
        - :~> rpm -q bash   (Version of package installed)
        - :~> rpm -qf /bin/bash     (which package file came from)
        - :~> rpm -ql bash  (what files were installed by this package)
        - :~> rpm -qi bash  (show info about the package)
        - :~> rpm -qip foo-1.0.0-1.noarch.rpm   (show info about package from the package file, not the package db)
        - :~> rpm -qa       (list all installed packages on this system)
        - :~> rpm -qp --requires foo-1.0.0-1.noarch.rpm (--requires option will return a list of prerequisites for a package)
        - :~> rpm -q --whatprovides libc.so.6       (--whatprovides option will show what installed package provides a particular requisite pkg)
- Verifying Packages
    - :~> rmp -Va       (No output is generated when everything is ok)
        - s: file size differs
        - M: file permission or type differs
        - 5: MD5 checksum differs
        - D: device major/minor num mismatch
        - L: symbolic link path mismatch
        - U: user ownership differs
        - G: group ownership differs
        - T: modification time differs
        - P: capabilities differ
- Installing Packages
    - :~> sudo rpm -ivh bash-4.4.19-8.e18_0.x86_64
        - where -i = install, -v = verbose, -h = print out hash marks while doing to show progress
    - Tasks performed by RPM when installing a package
        - dependency checks
        - conflict checks
        - executes commands required before installation
        - deals intelligently with config files
        - unpacks files from packages and installs them with correct attributes
        - executes commands required after installation
        - updates the system RPM database
- Uninstalling Packages
    - :~> sudo rpm -e system-config-lvm
        - where -e = erase(uninstall) package
- Updating Packages
    - :~> rpm -Uvh bash-4.4.19-10.e18.x86_64.rpm
        - where -U = upgrade
        - use --oldpackage option to downgrade with rpm -U
- Freshening Packages
    - :~> sudo rpm -Fvh *.rpm
        - if old version of package is installed, it is upgraded
        - if same version, nothing happens
        - if no version is installed, it is ignored
    - useful when applying patches
- Grasp why new kernels should be installed, rather than upgraded
    - :~> sudo rpm -ivh kernel-{version}.{arch}.rpm
    - allows to boot from old kernel if error happens during upgrade
- Using rpm2cpio
    - converts RPM packages to cpio archives
        - :~> rpm2cpio foobar.rpm > foobar.cpio
    - lists files in an RPM package file
        - :~> rpm2cpio bash-XXXX.rpm | cpio -t
    - better way to do same thing:
        - :~> rpm -qlp bash-XXXX.rpm
    - extract one or more files from an RPM package file into the system
        - :~> rpm2cpio bash-XXXX.rpm | cpio -ivd bin/bash
        - :~> rpm2cpio logrotate-XXXX.rpm | cpio --extract --make-directories

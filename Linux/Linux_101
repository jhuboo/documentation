-----------------
Chapter 1 Summary
-----------------
- The Linux Foudation is the umbrella organization for several open-source projects
  Like Linux, and its work today extends far beyond that to every layer of the software stack
- The 3 major distribution families within Linux are:
    - Red Hat
    - SUSE
    - Debian
    
-----------------
Chapter 2 Summary
-----------------
- Linux is heavily influenced by UNIX
- Linux accesses many features and services through files, and file-like objects
- Linux is fully multi-tasking, multi-user OS, with built-in networking and service processes known as daemons
- Linux is developed by collaboration of developers around the world, with Linus Torvalds at the head.
  Technical Skill and a desire to contribute are the only qualification for participating.
- Common terms used in Linux are:
    - Kernel
    - Distribution
    - Boot loader
    - Service
    - Filesystem
    - X Window system
    - desktop
    - environment
    - command line
- A full Linux distro consists of a kernel and several other packages for file-related operations, user management, and software package management.

Chapter 3 Summary
-----------------
- A partition is a logical volume of the disk.
- A filesystem is a method of storing/finding files on a hard disk.
- Dividing the hard disk into partitions enables data to be grouped and separated as needed.
  When a failure or mistake occurs, only the data in the affected partition will be damaged while data elsewhere will likely survive.
- The boot process starts with the: 1) BIOS                (initialization of hardware - also called POST)
  which triggers the              : 2) Boot loader         (Master Boot Record (MBR) searches for partition table then boot loader, like GRUB, for booting OS)
  to startup the                  : 3) Linux Kernel        (Kernel is loaded, and takes control in RAM. It is uncompressed, then initializes any built-in device drivers)
  Which invokes the               : 4) initramfs | initrd  (Contains binary files and programs that perform all actions needed to mount proper root filesystem.)
  Which triggers                  : 5) init program        (Handles mounting and pivoting over the final real root filesystem)

-----------------
Chapter 4 Summary
-----------------
- GNOME is a popular desktop environment and GUI that runs on top the Linux OS
- The default display manager is 'gdm': ~> : sudo systemctrl start|restart|stop gdm
- The Display manger handles:
    - Display management : (Keeps track of the displays)
    - X server           : (Provides graphical services to applications, called X Clients) | being replaced by Wayland | use :~> : startx
    - Graphical logins   : (Handles graphical logins, and appropriate desktop environments after login)
- Nautilus gives three format to view files:
    - Ctrl-F   : (search box)
    - Ctrl-L   : (specific directory)
    - Combine
- Deleting a file in Nautilus will automatically move the deleted files to the : ~> : cd '.local/share/Trash/files/'
- Latest modified file can be viewed under : ~> : var/log
- gedit is the default GNOME editor
- Access gnome-tweaks or konsole (!typo) using Alt + F2

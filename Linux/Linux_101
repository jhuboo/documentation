-----------------
Chapter 1 Summary
-----------------
- The Linux Foudation is the umbrella organization for several open-source projects
  Like Linux, and its work today extends far beyond that to every layer of the software stack
- The 3 major distribution families within Linux are:
    - Red Hat
    - SUSE
    - Debian
 
    
-----------------
Chapter 2 Summary
-----------------
- Linux is heavily influenced by UNIX
- Linux accesses many features and services through files, and file-like objects
- Linux is fully multi-tasking, multi-user OS, with built-in networking and service processes known as daemons
- Linux is developed by collaboration of developers around the world, with Linus Torvalds at the head.
  Technical Skill and a desire to contribute are the only qualification for participating.
- Common terms used in Linux are:
    - Kernel
    - Distribution
    - Boot loader
    - Service
    - Filesystem
    - X Window system
    - desktop
    - environment
    - command line
- A full Linux distro consists of a kernel and several other packages for file-related operations, user management, and software package management.

-----------------
Chapter 3 Summary
-----------------
- A partition is a logical volume of the disk.
- A filesystem is a method of storing/finding files on a hard disk.
- Dividing the hard disk into partitions enables data to be grouped and separated as needed.
  When a failure or mistake occurs, only the data in the affected partition will be damaged while data elsewhere will likely survive.
- The boot process starts with the: 1) BIOS                (initialization of hardware - also called POST)
  which triggers the              : 2) Boot loader         (Master Boot Record (MBR) searches for partition table then boot loader, like GRUB, for booting OS)
  to startup the                  : 3) Linux Kernel        (Kernel is loaded, and takes control in RAM. It is uncompressed, then initializes any built-in device drivers)
  Which invokes the               : 4) initramfs | initrd  (Contains binary files and programs that perform all actions needed to mount proper root filesystem.)
  Which triggers                  : 5) init program        (Handles mounting and pivoting over the final real root filesystem)


-----------------
Chapter 4 Summary
-----------------
- GNOME is a popular desktop environment and GUI that runs on top the Linux OS
- The default display manager is 'gdm': ~> : sudo systemctrl start|restart|stop gdm
- The Display manger handles:
    - Display management : (Keeps track of the displays)
    - X server           : (Provides graphical services to applications, called X Clients) | being replaced by Wayland | use :~> : startx
    - Graphical logins   : (Handles graphical logins, and appropriate desktop environments after login)
- Nautilus gives three format to view files:
    - Ctrl-F   : (search box)
    - Ctrl-L   : (specific directory)
    - Combine
- Deleting a file in Nautilus will automatically move the deleted files to the : ~> : cd '.local/share/Trash/files/'
- Latest modified file can be viewed under : ~> : var/log
- gedit is the default GNOME editor


-----------------
Chapter 5 Summary
-----------------
- Access gnome-tweaks using Alt + F2
- The X server, which provides the GUI, uses : ~> : cd /etc/X11/xorg.conf (if it exists, this is only present in modern Linux distros under unusual circumstances)
- Linux uses Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) for its own internal time keeping, (Also look for CMOS bios)
- Network Time Protocal (NTP) is hte most reliable protocol for setting the local time by consulting internet servers. :~> : cd /etc/ntp.conf
- Network Manager handles network configuration files, and makes it easier and more uniform across distros.
- For Wired connections, the hardware interface and signal are automatically detected and the Network Manager sets the network settings using DHCP
  For static configurations that do not use DHCP, manual setup can be done easily through Network Manager. 
  The Media Access Control (MAC) is the unique hex number of the network card.
  For wireless networks, you can view the list of available wireless networks and see which one you are connected to using Network Manager.
  VPN connections are also supported, including native IPSec, Cisco OpenConnect, Microsoft PPTP, OpenVPN
- For the Debian family system, the package management system is:
    - dpkg  : (Debian Package) - low level
    - apt   : (Advanced Package Tool) - high level
- For the Red Hat family system, it is:
    - rpm   : (Red Hat Package Manager) - low level
    - yum | dnf | zypper | PackageKit - high level
- For OpenSUSE, it is:
    - rpm
    - YaST
    
    
-----------------
Chapter 6 Summary
-----------------
- Linux supports several web browsers including Firefox, Chrome, Epiphany, Brave, w3m, lynx, etc
- Linux supports graphical email clients like Thunderbird, Evolution, Claws Mail, and text mode email clients like Mutt, and mail.
- Linux systems also support Filezilla, XChat, Pidgin, etc
- Linux offers LibreOffice
- Linux offers GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) which is like Photoshop
- Linux offers suits of development applications and tools, like compilers and debuggers
- Linux offers sound players like Amarok, Audacity, Rhythmbos, and Spotify among others
- Linux offers movie players including VLC, Plex, MPlayer, Xine, Totem, etc
- Linux offers movie editors including Kino, Cinepaint, Blender, etc
- Other graphical utilities includ eog, Inkscape, convert, Scribus, etc


-----------------
Chapter 7 Summary
-----------------
- Virtual Terminals (VT) are console sessions that use the entire display and keyboard outside of a graphical environment.
  They are considered "virtual" because, although there can be multiple active terminals, only one terminal remains visible at a time.
  One VT is reserved for the graphical enviroment. (Ubuntu uses VT 7)
  The VTs can be accessed using : ~> : Ctrl-Alt-F[2-7]
  To go back to your home VT: ~> : Ctrl-Alt-F2
- A terminal emulator program on a graphical desktop works by emulating a terminal within a window on the desktop.
  Access the gnome-terminal by doing : ~> : Alt-F2 and then type 'gnome-terminal'
  Other terminal programs include: xterm, rxvt, konsole (default on KDE), terminator
- The Graphical desktop can be switched on and off with systemctl utility or telinit:
    - : ~> : sudo systemctl stop gdm          : (or sudo telinit 3)
    - : ~> : sudo systemctl start|restart gdm : (or sudo telinit 5)
- Basic Command line utilities:
    - cat   : (used to type out a file or combine files)
    - head  : (used to show the first few lines of a file, default 10)
    - tail  : (used to show the last few lines of a file, default 10)
    - less  : (same as cat, but with scrolling)
    - man   : (used to view documentation)
- Most input lines entered at the shell prompt has 3 basic elements:
    - Command
    - Options
    - Arguments
- Sudo (stands for Superuser do) allows users to run programs using the security priviledges of root, or another user
- Setting up and running sudo:
    - : ~> : su (Enter)
    - : ~> : su Password: #
    - : ~> : echo "myusername ALL=(ALL) ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/myusername  : (Create config file in /etc/sudoers.d)
    - : ~> : chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/myusername : (Change permissions for smooth operations)
- Loggin In and Out
    - An available text terminal will prompt for a username (with string login:) and password
    - Nothing is displayed on the terminal when typing in the password to prevent others from seeing it
    - You can also connect and log into remote systems by using SSH (Secure Shell)
    - To do so, type ~> ssh example@remote-server.com
    - SSH connects to the remote machine, giving a command line terminal window, verifying identity using either password or crytographic key
- Shutdown
    - : ~> sudo shutdown -h 10:00 "Shutting down for scheduled maintance"
    - : ~> tldr shutdown : (for more commands)
- Locating Applications
    - which diff     ~> /usr/bin/diff  : ('which' locates exact source, 'whereis' locates source and man files, broader range of sys dir)
    - whereis diff   ~> diff: /usr/bin/diff  /usr/share/man/man1/diff.1.gz  /usr/share/man/man1p/diff.1p.gz
- Accessing directories
    - : ~> pwd   : (Displays present working directory)
    - : ~> cd ~  : (Changes to home directory, same as only : ~> cd)
    - : ~> cd .. : (Change to parent directory ..)
    - : ~> cd -  : (Change to previous directory (- (minus))
- Paths
    - Absolute pathname : (begin with root dir and follows the tree, branch by branch until it reaches desired dir or file) Always start with: /
    - Relative pathname : (starts from present working directory) Never starts with: /
        - ie : ~> cd /usr/bin      : (Absolute path)
        - ie : ~> cd ../../usr/bin : (Relative path)
- Exploring Filesytem
    - : ~> cd /  : (Changes your current dir to the root (/) dir)
    - : ~> ls    : (list contents of pwd)
    - : ~> ls -a : (list all files, including hidden files and directories)
    - : ~> tree  : Displays a tree view of the filesystem

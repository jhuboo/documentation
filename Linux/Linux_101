-----------------
Chapter 1 Summary
-----------------
- The Linux Foudation is the umbrella organization for several open-source projects
  Like Linux, and its work today extends far beyond that to every layer of the software stack
- The 3 major distribution families within Linux are:
    - Red Hat
    - SUSE
    - Debian
 
    
-----------------
Chapter 2 Summary
-----------------
- Linux is heavily influenced by UNIX
- Linux accesses many features and services through files, and file-like objects
- Linux is fully multi-tasking, multi-user OS, with built-in networking and service processes known as daemons
- Linux is developed by collaboration of developers around the world, with Linus Torvalds at the head.
  Technical Skill and a desire to contribute are the only qualification for participating.
- Common terms used in Linux are:
    - Kernel
    - Distribution
    - Boot loader
    - Service
    - Filesystem
    - X Window system
    - desktop
    - environment
    - command line
- A full Linux distro consists of a kernel and several other packages for file-related operations, user management, and software package management.

-----------------
Chapter 3 Summary
-----------------
- A partition is a logical volume of the disk.
- A filesystem is a method of storing/finding files on a hard disk.
- Dividing the hard disk into partitions enables data to be grouped and separated as needed.
  When a failure or mistake occurs, only the data in the affected partition will be damaged while data elsewhere will likely survive.
- The boot process starts with the: 1) BIOS                (initialization of hardware - also called POST)
  which triggers the              : 2) Boot loader         (Master Boot Record (MBR) searches for partition table then boot loader, like GRUB, for booting OS)
  to startup the                  : 3) Linux Kernel        (Kernel is loaded, and takes control in RAM. It is uncompressed, then initializes any built-in device drivers)
  Which invokes the               : 4) initramfs | initrd  (Contains binary files and programs that perform all actions needed to mount proper root filesystem.)
  Which triggers                  : 5) init program        (Handles mounting and pivoting over the final real root filesystem)


-----------------
Chapter 4 Summary
-----------------
- GNOME is a popular desktop environment and GUI that runs on top the Linux OS
- The default display manager is 'gdm': ~> : sudo systemctrl start|restart|stop gdm
- The Display manger handles:
    - Display management : (Keeps track of the displays)
    - X server           : (Provides graphical services to applications, called X Clients) | being replaced by Wayland | use :~> : startx
    - Graphical logins   : (Handles graphical logins, and appropriate desktop environments after login)
- Nautilus gives three format to view files:
    - Ctrl-F   : (search box)
    - Ctrl-L   : (specific directory)
    - Combine
- Deleting a file in Nautilus will automatically move the deleted files to the : ~> : cd '.local/share/Trash/files/'
- Latest modified file can be viewed under : ~> : var/log
- gedit is the default GNOME editor


-----------------
Chapter 5 Summary
-----------------
- Access gnome-tweaks using Alt + F2
- The X server, which provides the GUI, uses : ~> : cd /etc/X11/xorg.conf (if it exists, this is only present in modern Linux distros under unusual circumstances)
- Linux uses Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) for its own internal time keeping, (Also look for CMOS bios)
- Network Time Protocal (NTP) is hte most reliable protocol for setting the local time by consulting internet servers. :~> : cd /etc/ntp.conf
- Network Manager handles network configuration files, and makes it easier and more uniform across distros.
- For Wired connections, the hardware interface and signal are automatically detected and the Network Manager sets the network settings using DHCP
  For static configurations that do not use DHCP, manual setup can be done easily through Network Manager. 
  The Media Access Control (MAC) is the unique hex number of the network card.
  For wireless networks, you can view the list of available wireless networks and see which one you are connected to using Network Manager.
  VPN connections are also supported, including native IPSec, Cisco OpenConnect, Microsoft PPTP, OpenVPN
- For the Debian family system, the package management system is:
    - dpkg  : (Debian Package) - low level
    - apt   : (Advanced Package Tool) - high level
- For the Red Hat family system, it is:
    - rpm   : (Red Hat Package Manager) - low level
    - yum | dnf | zypper | PackageKit - high level
- For OpenSUSE, it is:
    - rpm
    - YaST
    
    
-----------------
Chapter 6 Summary
-----------------
- Linux supports several web browsers including Firefox, Chrome, Epiphany, Brave, w3m, lynx, etc
- Linux supports graphical email clients like Thunderbird, Evolution, Claws Mail, and text mode email clients like Mutt, and mail.
- Linux systems also support Filezilla, XChat, Pidgin, etc
- Linux offers LibreOffice
- Linux offers GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) which is like Photoshop
- Linux offers suits of development applications and tools, like compilers and debuggers
- Linux offers sound players like Amarok, Audacity, Rhythmbos, and Spotify among others
- Linux offers movie players including VLC, Plex, MPlayer, Xine, Totem, etc
- Linux offers movie editors including Kino, Cinepaint, Blender, etc
- Other graphical utilities includ eog, Inkscape, convert, Scribus, etc


-----------------
Chapter 7 Summary
-----------------
- A terminal emulator program on a graphical desktop works by emulating a terminal within a window on the desktop.
  Access the gnome-terminal by doing : ~> : Alt-F2 and then type 'gnome-terminal'
  Other terminal programs include: xterm, rxvt, konsole (default on KDE), terminator
- Basic Command line utilities:
    - cat   : (used to type out a file or combine files)
    - head  : (used to show the first few lines of a file, default 10)
    - tail  : (used to show the last few lines of a file, default 10)
    - less  : (same as cat, but with scrolling)
    - man   : (used to view documentation)

Brief history:
C++ is a general purpose programming language, which also happens to support the OOP framework.
The 4 pillars of OOP are:
    1) Encapsulation
    2) Abstraction
    3) Inheritance
    4) Polymorphism
    
Philosophy of C++:
    - Driven by actual problems and features should be immediately useful in real-world programs;
    - Every feature should be implementable;
    - Programmers should be free to pick their own style
    - No implicit violations of the type system
    - There should be no language beneath C++ except assembly
    - Allow manual control
    
// Hello World in C++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    
    std::cout << "Hello, world!\n";

}
